## Twitter Files Brazil 3: the left was also affected

In my speech during the hearing in the Federal Senate, on April 11, I highlighted that the fight for freedom of expression and the privacy of citizens is not left or right, as it affects everyone. Now I, @EliVieiraJr and @shellenberger disclose in this new edition of #TwitterFilesBrazil that Brazilians from different political spectrums, including left-wing politicians, were targeted by the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) and the Federal Police for data collection and censorship on Twitter.

Contrary to what some falsely claimed, Twitter Files Brazil had no participation from Elon Musk. Shellenberger already had the complete file since the end of 2022, delivered to him and other independent journalists by Musk and at the time only interested in the American context. The owner of X learned about Twitter Files Brazil like everyone else except the three of us: through our publications on this social network. We thank @elonmusk for the attention he gave to our publications and for the transparency in opening the files in 2022.

Although the right has been the main target of censorship and persecution, as we can see in the Twitter Files and in the document made available by the US House of Representatives Judiciary Committee last week, the left was also affected by illegal orders from the TSE.

## Here is a summary of all cases:

I- The TSE ordered that data from users who tweeted hashtags against and in favor of printed ballots be delivered by Twitter. Parliamentarians may have been affected;
II- The TSE ordered the blocking of the social networks of @PCO29, a left-wing political party, due to criticism of the court and the electoral process. The Party remained blocked throughout the 2022 electoral period;
III- Left-wing profiles on Twitter were blocked at the request of the TSE due to publications on other platforms.

## The case of hashtags

The most serious case is the hunt for users who tweeted certain hashtags between 2021 and 2022. The TSE suspected that hashtags referring to Twitter campaigns about a legislative proposal for printed ballots were being used in discussions that could “influence or manipulate public opinion about the electoral system”.

Hashtags are keywords used to index a topic or discussion on Twitter. By clicking on a hashtag, you can view all publications on the same topic. As we revealed in Twitter Files Brazil 1, the TSE wanted:

I- Identify the first users to publish these hashtags;
II- that Twitter produce chronological progression reports of these hashtags and potential suspicious behaviors.
III- In addition, the TSE also wanted to somehow reduce the engagement of specific content on the platform (i.e., prevent specific accounts from being suggested to other people).

These requests surprised the Twitter team, who in an internal conversation highlighted the unusual nature of the requests coming from this investigation. According to Diego de Lima Gualda, Twitter's Legal Director for Latin America, the TSE pressured for private user data under the justification of “exceptional circumstances” and wanted to use Twitter as a crime precognition machine to “anticipate possible illegal activities”.

According to a member of the Twitter team, from a legal point of view, these requests were questionable in light of Brazilian statutes and court precedents, as they would violate user privacy and due process rights. The lawyer feared that the request would lead to a “potential massive disclosure of an undetermined number of users, without clear cause and without prior judicial oversight”. The TSE's initial requests could expose data from up to 260,000 accounts.

After Twitter's protests, only about 200 accounts would be affected. Still, Twitter believed the number was “very significant and an exception based on typical cases we deal with in Brazil”. This was the opinion of Diego de Lima Gualda, Twitter and X's legal director until this month, in a conversation with Twitter's senior legal director in global litigation at the time, Karen Colangelo, in an internal email dated August 18, 2022. Concerned, Colangelo asked Gualda if the TSE would continue to demand data: “at what point do we draw the line?”

For approximately one year, Twitter reacted to these demands from the TSE and the Federal Police, claiming that they were illegal and did not respect the Internet Civil Framework. Rafael Batista, Twitter's senior legal consultant, said that Twitter “would react” because “there was no evidence of illegality in the use of hashtags” and because the TSE demanded “mass and indiscriminate disclosure of private user data”, which would characterize “violation of privacy and other constitutional rights”.

In a previous email exchange, on May 13, 2022, the Twitter legal team highlighted that the TSE had no interest in the investigation becoming public. Twitter's concern was that this sensitive user data would be disclosed, especially since the final decision on disclosure rests exclusively with the TSE. Colangelo expressed concern about hiding Twitter's participation in providing user data: “is there any way to ensure (or at least try to protect) the confidentiality of this information and also the fact that we provided it?”

The conversations between Gualda and Colangelo came after a meeting between Gualda and the Federal Police on May 12. The Brazilian reports that from Twitter's point of view there was no “coordinated inauthentic behavior” of the accounts targeted by the PF. The PF would have explained, according to him, that finding such coordination was its objective. Corroborating the information from previous editions of the Twitter Files, Gualda's email recounting the meeting corroborates that Meta and Google adopted “extraordinary measures” to collaborate more with the authorities (potentially in the release of private data in violation of the Civil Framework) than Twitter.

## Requested Data

On March 30, 2022, Gualda stated that the TSE had stipulated a 7-day deadline for data delivery under penalty of a daily fine of 50,000 reais. (approximately 10,000 dollars).

In this request, the Federal Police demanded that the social network provide data from the hashtags #VotoDemocraticoAuditavel and #BarrosoNaCadeia, which we presented in the first Twitter Files Brazil. In addition to these, the hashtag #VotoImpressoNão was also requested. We observed, however, greater interest in the search for the former. In the email, Gualda says that the court had revoked “the previous decision to provide user data regarding the ‘first users’ of #BarrosoNaCadeia and #VotoImpressoNão”.

But in that message of May 12, it is clear that the TSE again targets the hashtag #VotoImpressoNão for other users. The requested data for the hashtag #VotoImpressoNão were:

– registration data of those who tweeted this hashtag in text spreadsheet or CSV spreadsheet format;
– account signature data (such as username, email, phone, and age);
– the access IP after the tweet;
– date and time;
– and content of all tweets associated with the hashtag.

## Context

The period established for the search of this hashtag was from August 9 to August 12, 2021. This period coincides with the voting of a proposal for the adoption of printed ballots in Brazilian elections. The printed ballot issue is controversial in Brazil. Although parliament has approved at least three proposals for the adoption of printed ballots, the Supreme Court and the TSE have always rejected the idea, even with its broad popular support, and insist on the use of first-generation electronic voting machines. In recent years, the idea has become linked to Bolsonarism, which has caused many historical defenders to “change sides”.

During the fourth attempt, there was intense dispute in Congress for the voting of the proposal and even STF ministers worked lobbying against the proposal. Social networks were another stage of this dispute and hashtags were used to distribute messages, slogans against or in favor of the project.

The proposal was not approved even with the majority of votes in favor of printing the ballots, as the minimum required number of 308 favorable votes was not reached. The voting result was 229 votes in favor, 218 against, and 1 abstention.

## Affected leftists

Among the profiles of left-wing personalities who legitimately campaigned against the printed ballot within this period, and using the hashtag #VotoImpressoNão, we highlight: federal deputies Luiza Erundina (@luizaerundina), Tábata Amaral (@tabataamaralsp) and Joenia Wapichana (@JoeniaWapichana). Also state deputy Erica Malunguinho (@malunguinho) and influencers Lázaro Rosa (@lazarorosa25) and FalaMuka (@falamuka).

An interesting case is that of the Jairme (@jairmearrependi) profile, an anonymous account used for political militancy against Bolsonaro. This profile has already been targeted by legal attempts to unmask its owner under accusation of irregular political propaganda. There has been intense debate about the ethical and legal issues in the use of anonymous profiles on the internet, since the Brazilian Constitution conditions freedom of expression on non-anonymity. Today the profile remains anonymous. But, considering that Jairme tweeted the hashtag against the printed ballot during this period, it is possible that his data was sent by Twitter and could reveal his author.

Deputies Alessandro Molon (@alessandromolon) and Sâmia Bomfim (@samiabomfim) also used the hashtag, but outside the period stipulated by the PF.

## The case of PCO, the banned party

Another prominent case of censorship on the left is that of the Workers' Cause Party (PCO), a Brazilian political party considered far-left that, despite being an ally of President Lula, is an exceptional case in the political scenario due to its critical stance on the Judiciary and defense of policies not usually associated with the traditional left, such as freedom of expression and the right to bear arms.

The PCO is a tiny party. Even if it had no intention of electing a president in 2022 (its presidential candidate received 0.05% of the votes), the PCO was electorally harmed by being completely censored on several social networks — before and after the 2022 elections — after accusing the TSE of attempts at electoral fraud aimed at harming Lula in the elections.

## Some of PCO's statements used by Moraes for censorship:

\- “In a frenzy for dictatorship, the toga skinhead mutilates the right to expression, and prepares a new coup in the elections. The repression of rights always workers! Dissolution of the STF"

\- “It is necessary to adopt a concrete policy against the dictatorship of the STF. Fight for the total dissolution of the court and for the election of judges with revocable mandates".

\- “Superior Electoral Court wants to impose censorship on political manifestations in shows. Fascist Alexandre de Moraes is one of the pillars of the judiciary's dictatorship and will preside over the TSE in these elections. #ForaBolsonaro #LulaPresidente #PCO".

An email from Twitter's legal team sent on June 6, 2022, highlighted an order received from Moraes to immediately block PCO's profile on Twitter. The justification was the inclusion of the party in the Fake News Inquiry, with the requirement that Twitter also identify the account creator and preserve all associated content, including deleted content. The company planned to partially comply with the order, providing basic data and content, but would challenge the account suspension, highlighting PCO's legal legitimacy as a registered party in Brazil.

In the documents recently made available by the US House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, there are two measures applied to the PCO during the 2022 elections. The first is a subpoena issued by Moraes "ex officio", that is, initiated by the judge himself without any external request, on June 17, 2022, ordering the blocking of PCO's social networks, including Twitter, within a period of 24 hours. In case of non-compliance with this order, a daily fine of 20,000 reais was stipulated.

The second document reveals that only on February 28, 2023, almost four months after the elections, the restrictions imposed on PCO's social networks were finally revoked. Moraes justified the unblocking decision by arguing that there was a cessation of the dissemination of content considered illicit that could compromise the integrity of the electoral process. However, the decision still imposed a daily fine of 10,000 reais in case of future non-compliance.

## Blocked left-wing profiles

There are two more cases that affected left-wing groups and in which Twitter challenged the TSE's orders.

Bolsoflix

The first is that of the Bolsoflix website, an anonymous platform that aimed to "rebut the arguments" spread by Bolsonaro and his supporters. The site gathered critical videos of the president to be distributed on WhatsApp.

The TSE ordered its removal from the air, arguing that the Bolsoflix platform, by being hosted outside Brazil and associated with a foreign company, violated Brazilian electoral rules, which require that electoral propaganda be transmitted only by sites based in Brazil and not by private companies.

The TSE included in its decision the Twitter profile @BolsoflixReal demanding its suspension and availability of account data under a daily fine of R$ 10 thousand (US$ 1,9 thousand). In the Twitter Files the Twitter legal team argued that the TSE's decision did not consider any specific content posted by the profile that could be considered illegal or irregular. It stated that the order was based solely on the profile's association with the third-party website and defended that it could remove specific illegal content, without the need to suspend the entire profile. Therefore, it questioned the decision, alleging disproportionality and lack of specificity in the analysis of the actual content of the @BolsoflixReal profile.

## Truth on the Net

Similar to the Bolsoflix case, The TSE ordered the removal of the website "", linked to Lula's campaign. The justification was that the website and the associated Twitter profile, @verdadenarede, misled the public by presenting themselves as an independent fact-checking agency, while in reality they were part of the official electoral campaign.

According to an internal Twitter email sent by a lawyer member of the company's legal team (here anonymized for not being senior), the platform challenged the TSE's decision. The legal team argued that no analysis had been made of specific content posted that could be considered illegal or irregular. They emphasized that, although they could remove specific illegal content, the total suspension of the profile was disproportionate and based solely on the profile's association with the third-party website.

Both Bolsoflix and Verdade na Rede profiles remain “retained in Brazil in response to a legal demand”.[verdadenarede.com.br](http://verdadenarede.com.br/)

## PGR requisita dados de tuítes antigos de jornalista

Um outro caso é o do apresentador da Rede Globo Felipe Andreoli (@andreolifelipe), que se tornou alvo da Procuradoria-Geral da República. Andreoli encabeçou campanhas de cancelamento contra o jogador de volêi Maurício Souza (@VoleiSouza) acusado de comportamento homofóbico. Atualmente, Souza é deputado federal. Na sequência, o próprio Andreoli foi cancelado por causa de tuítes preconceituosos publicados por ele em 2010.

Embora Andreoli tenha se desculpado e afirmado que hoje é uma “pessoa melhor”, o Ministério Público Federal enviou ao Twitter um pedido de “preservação” de IPs relativos a esses tuítes. O Twitter se recusou a atender ao pedido pois não teria recebido as URLs específicas, apenas capturas de tela. Além disso, não teria sido seguido o que determina o Acordo de Assistência Judiciária em Matéria Penal (MLAT).

## Um chamado à mudança

Estes casos demonstram que, embora a direita tenha sido perseguida com mais intensidade nos últimos anos, a esquerda também pode ser afetada por censura ou solicitação indevida de dados.

Em 2014 foi aprovado no Brasil o Marco Civil da Internet, lei que assegura direitos e estabelece deveres no uso da internet no país. Implementado após longa discussão com a sociedade, o Marco Civil é um lei robusta que garante a proteção da privacidade e dos dados pessoais dos usuários, estipulando que qualquer coleta, uso ou divulgação de informações pessoais deve ser feita com transparência, finalidade específica e consentimento do usuário. O Marco Civil também protege a liberdade de expressão na internet, garantindo que o acesso e o uso da rede sejam livres e que não haja censura prévia.

Além do Marco Civil, o Brasil possui uma lei específica para proteger a privacidade e os dados dos cidadãos na internet, a Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD), aprovada em 2018.

Ao invés de respeitar o Marco Civil e a LGPD, o governo Brasileiro tem tentado aprovar leis que colocam a liberdade de expressão em risco. Uma destas leis é o PL 2630/2020, também chamado de PL das Fake News. ONGs financiadas por bilionários, como George Soros, militantes de esquerda e partidários do presidente Lula têm defendido propostas deste tipo, aproveitando que há uma tendência judicial a seu favor neste momento. Mas, para quem apelarão quando os juízes resolverem mudar de lado (mais uma vez)?__

Para uma organização diferente das informações acima e duas entrevistas com as pessoas que o TSE parece ter pensado que criaram a hashtag pelo voto impresso, confiram minha reportagem na @gazetadopovo:
