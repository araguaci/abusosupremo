An extremist imperialist global conspiracy aimed at misleading the public and undermining democracy was behind the April 3, 2024 publication of the [“Twitter Files Brazil](https://twitter.com/shellenberger/status/1775516415023251835?lang=en),” say leading Brazilian journalists, researchers, and social media influencers.

Intercept Brasil [claimed](https://www.intercept.com.br/2024/04/18/comite-dos-eua-defende-ate-grupo-neonazista-para-atacar-alexandre-de-moraes-e-o-brasil/) that the U.S. House Judiciary Committee, which had produced a [report](https://judiciary.house.gov/media/press-releases/brazilian-government-forced-censorship-x-new-report-reveals) on censorship in Brazil, inspired by the Twitter Files Brazil, was defending neo-Nazi groups in order to attack Supreme Court Justice, Alexandre de Moraes.

NetLab, a research laboratory based at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro on April 24th [claimed in a report](https://netlab.eco.ufrj.br/post/a-atividade-de-perfis-inaut%C3%AAnticos-no-debate-sobre-elon-musk-e-alexandre-de-moraes-no-x-antigo-tw) that X owner Elon Musk had used “bots,” or fake users, to criticize de Moraes on X.

And a YouTube influencer named Felipe Neto, who has 46 million followers, [claimed on ICL](https://twitter.com/ICLNoticias/status/1778776378982137857), a public TV station, that the Twitter Files were Musk’s attempt to manipulate public opinion through “pseudo-journalists.”

But none of those claims are true.

The House Judiciary report did not defend neo-Nazis. It simply listed them among many other cases of censorship.

There is no evidence to support NetLab’s conspiracy theory that Musk unleashed a bot attack. NetLab likely mislabeled authentic users as bots. But it’s impossible to know since the report is self-published, obscures its methodology, and can’t be replicated.

And, as my colleagues Michael Shellenberger and Eli Viera have repeatedly noted, in Portuguese and English, on X, in numerous articles, and while testifying, twice, before Brazil’s Congress, we are not part of any conspiracy. Musk did not know we would publish the Twitter Files Brazil, nor did the Brazilian politicians who reacted to them.

Even so, the conspiracy theories about Twitter Files Brazil have had a major impact.
