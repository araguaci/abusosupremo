## Twitter Files Brazil 3 - the left was also targeted

During my speech at the Brazilian Federal Senate hearing on April 11, I emphasized that the fight for freedom of expression and citizens' privacy is neither a left nor right-wing issue, as it affects everyone. Now, @EliVieiraJr, @shellenberger, and I reveal in this new edition of #TwitterFilesBrazil that Brazilians across the political spectrum, including left-wing politicians, were targeted by the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) and the Federal Police for data collection and censorship on Twitter.

Contrary to what some have falsely claimed, Elon Musk was not involved with Twitter Files Brazil. Shellenberger had been in possession of the full database since late 2022, received from Musk and distributed to him and other independent journalists, with Musk's interest then focused solely on the American scenario. The owner of X became aware of Twitter Files Brazil in the same manner as the general public—through our social media posts, with the exception of the three of us involved. We extend our thanks to @elonmusk for the attention he directed towards our posts and for his openness in making these files available in 2022.

Although the right has been the primary target of censorship and persecution, as evidenced in the Twitter Files and the documents released last week by the US House Judiciary Committee, the left has also been impacted by the TSE's illegal orders.

## Here is a summary:

I - The TSE ordered Twitter to hand over data from users who tweeted hashtags both against and in favor of printed voting. Legislators may have been affected;\
II - The TSE ordered the blocking of social media accounts of @PCO29, a left-wing political party, due to criticism of the court and the electoral process. The party remained blocked throughout the 2022 electoral period;\
III - Popular left-wing Twitter profiles were blocked at the request of the TSE due to posts on other platforms.

## The Hashtag Hunt

The most serious issue concerns the targeting of users who tweeted certain hashtags between 2021 and 2022. The TSE suspected that hashtags related to Twitter campaigns about a legislative proposal for printed voting were being used in discussions that could "influence or manipulate public opinion about the electoral system."

Hashtags are keywords used to index a topic or discussion on Twitter. By clicking on a hashtag, you can view all posts on the same theme. As revealed in Twitter Files Brazil 1, the TSE aimed to:

I- Identify the first users who posted these hashtags;\
II- Require Twitter to produce reports on the chronological progression of these hashtags and potential suspicious behaviors.\
III- Additionally, the TSE sought to somehow reduce the engagement of specific content on the platform (i.e., prevent certain accounts from being recommended to others).

These requests surprised Twitter's team, who internally noted the unusual nature of the demands from this investigation. According to Diego de Lima Gualda, Twitter's Legal Director for Latin America, the TSE pushed for private user data under the guise of "exceptional circumstances" and wanted to use Twitter as a crime precognition machine to "anticipate potential illegal activities."

A member of Twitter's team noted that legally, these requests were questionable under Brazilian statutes and precedents, as they would violate user privacy and due process rights. The lawyer feared that complying could lead to a "potential massive disclosure of an undetermined number of users, without clear cause and without prior judicial oversight." The TSE's initial requests could have exposed data from up to 260,000 accounts. After Twitter's objections, only about 200 accounts would be affected. Nevertheless, Twitter believed the number was "very significant and an exception based on the typical cases we handle in Brazil."

This was the view of Diego de Lima Gualda, Twitter's and X’s legal director until this month, during a conversation with Karen Colangelo, Twitter’s senior legal director in global litigation at the time, in an internal email dated August 18, 2022. Concerned, Colangelo asked Gualda if the TSE would continue to demand data: "At what point do we draw the line?"

Over the course of about a year, Twitter responded to these demands from the TSE and Federal Police, arguing that they were illegal and did not respect the “Marco Civil da Internet”, law that regulates the use of the Internet in Brazil. Rafael Batista, Twitter's Senior Legal Consultant, stated that Twitter "would push back" because "there were no signs of illegality in the use of hashtags" and because the TSE demanded "mass and indiscriminate disclosure of private user data, which constitutes a “violation of privacy and other constitutional rights.”

In an earlier email exchange on May 13, 2022, Twitter's legal team emphasized that the TSE had no interest in making the investigation public. Twitter was concerned that this sensitive user data could be exposed, especially since the final decision on disclosure rests solely with the TSE. Colangelo expressed concern about hiding Twitter's role in providing the user data: "Is there any way to ensure (or at least try to protect) the confidentiality of this information and also the fact that we provided it?"

The discussions between Gualda and Colangelo came after a meeting Gualda had with the Federal Police on May 12. Gualda reported that, from Twitter's perspective, there was no "coordinated inauthentic behavior" in the accounts targeted by the PF. According to him, the PF had stated that finding such coordination was their goal. Corroborating information from previous editions of the Twitter Files, Gualda’s email about the meeting indicates that Meta and Google had adopted "extraordinary measures" to collaborate more with the authorities (potentially in the release of private data in violation of the Marco Civil—Brazil's main Internet law) than Twitter.

## Requested Data

On March 30, 2022, Gualda stated that the TSE had set a deadline of 7 days for the data delivery, under penalty of a daily fine of 50,000 reais (approximately 10,000 dollars).

In this request, the Federal Police demanded that the social media provide data on the hashtags #VotoDemocraticoAuditavel (#AuditableDemocraticVote) and #BarrosoNaCadeia (#BarrosoInJail), which we introduced in the first Twitter Files Brazil. Additionally, the hashtag #VotoImpressoNão #PrintedVoteNo) was also requested. However, there seemed to be more interest in the earlier hashtags. In the email, Gualda mentioned that the court had revoked "the previous decision to provide user data regarding the 'first users' of #BarrosoNaCadeia and #VotoImpressoNão".

But in that message from May 12, it's clear that the TSE is targeting the hashtag #VotoImpressoNão for other users. The requested data for the hashtag #VotoImpressoNão included:

The data requested for the hashtag #VotoImpressoNão were:

– Registration data of those who tweeted this hashtag in a text spreadsheet or CSV format;\
– Account signature data (such as username, email, phone, and age);\
– The IP address used after the tweet;\
– Date and time;\
– and the content of all tweets associated with the hashtag.

## Context

The designated period for the search of this hashtag was from August 9 to August 12, 2021. This period coincides with the vote on a proposal to adopt printed voting in Brazilian elections. The issue of printed voting is controversial in Brazil. Although the parliament has passed at least three proposals for the adoption of printed voting, the Supreme Court and the TSE have always rejected the idea, despite its widespread popular support, and insist on using first-generation electronic voting machines. In recent years, the idea has been associated with Bolsonarism, causing many historical supporters to "switch sides."

During the fourth attempt, there was intense debate in Congress over the vote on the proposal, and even Supreme Court justices lobbied against it. Social media became another stage for this dispute, and the hashtags were used to distribute messages and slogans against or in favor of the project.

The proposal was not approved despite a majority of favorable votes for the printing of votes, as it did not reach the required minimum of 308 favorable votes. The result of the vote was 229 in favor, 218 against, and 1 abstention.

## Targeted Leftists

Among the profiles of left-wing personalities who campaigned—legitimately—against printed voting during this period, using the hashtag #VotoImpressoNão, we highlight: federal representatives Luiza Erundina (@luizaerundina), Tábata Amaral (@tabataamaralsp), and Joenia Wapichana (@JoeniaWapichana), the last one is the president of the National Foundation of Indigenous Peoples (Funai) in the Lula government.

Also, were affected the state representative Erica Malunguinho (@malunguinho) and influencers Lázaro Rosa (@lazarorosa25) and FalaMuka (@falamuka).

An interesting case is that of the profile Jairme (@jairmearrependi), an anonymous account used for political activism against Bolsonaro. This profile has been the target of legal attempts to unmask its responsible party under accusations of irregular political propaganda. There was intense debate about the ethical and legal issues in using anonymous profiles on the internet, as the Brazilian Constitution conditions freedom of expression on non-anonymity. Today, the profile remains anonymous. However, considering that Jairme tweeted the hashtag against printed voting during this period, it's possible that their data were sent by Twitter and might reveal the author.

Representatives Alessandro Molon (@alessandromolon) and Sâmia Bomfim (@samiabomfim) also used the hashtag, but outside the designated period set by the Federal Police.

## The Gagging of A Small Communist Party

Another notable case of censorship on the left involves the Workers' Cause Party (PCO), a Brazilian political party considered far-left. Despite being an ally of President Lula, PCO stands out in the political scene for its critical stance towards the Judiciary and advocacy for policies not typically associated with traditional left-wing politics, such as freedom of speech and the right to bear arms.

The PCO is a small party. Although it had no aspirations of winning the presidency in 2022 (its presidential candidate received 0.05% of the votes), the PCO was electorally harmed by being completely censored on various social media—before and after the 2022 elections—after accusing the TSE of electoral fraud attempts aimed at undermining Lula in the elections.

## Some of the PCO statements used by Moraes for censorship include:

\- "In a frenzy for dictatorship, the ‘skinhead in judge's robes’ slashes the right to expression, preparing a new coup in the elections. Repression of workers' rights always! Dissolution of the Supreme Court."

\- "A concrete policy against the dictatorship of the Supreme Court is necessary. Fight for the complete dissolution of the court and for the election of judges with revocable mandates."

\- "The Superior Electoral Court wants to impose censorship on political expressions at concerts. Fascist Alexandre de Moraes is one of the pillars of the judiciary dictatorship and will preside over the TSE in these elections. #OutWithBolsonaro #LulaPresident #PCO."

An email from Twitter's legal team sent on June 6, 2022, highlighted an order received from Moraes to immediately block the PCO's Twitter profile. The justification was the inclusion of the party in the Fake News Inquiry, with the demand that Twitter also identify the account creator and preserve all associated content, including deleted material. The company planned to comply partially with the order by providing basic data and content but would challenge the account suspension, emphasizing the PCO's legal legitimacy as a registered party in Brazil.

Documents recently made available by the US House Judiciary Committee detail two measures applied to the PCO during the 2022 elections. The first is a subpoena issued by Moraes "ex officio," meaning initiated by the judge himself without an external request, on June 17, 2022, ordering the blocking of the PCO's social media, including Twitter, within a 24-hour deadline. A daily fine of 20,000 reais was stipulated for non-compliance with this order.

The second document reveals that, only on February 28, 2023, nearly four months after the elections, the restrictions imposed on the PCO's social networks were finally lifted. Moraes justified the decision to unblock, arguing that the dissemination of content deemed illegal that could compromise the integrity of the electoral process had ceased. However, the decision still imposed a daily fine of 10,000 reais in case of future non-compliance.

## Left-Wing Profiles Blocked

There are two more cases that impacted left-wing groups where Twitter challenged orders from the TSE. The first involves the website Bolsoflix, an anonymous platform aimed at "countering the arguments" spread by Bolsonaro and his supporters. The site compiled videos critical of the president for distribution on WhatsApp.

The TSE ordered its removal, arguing that Bolsoflix, being hosted outside Brazil and linked to a foreign company, violated Brazilian electoral rules, which require that electoral advertising be transmitted only through sites based in Brazil and not by private companies.

In its decision, the TSE also targeted the Twitter profile of Bolsoflix, demanding its suspension and the provision of account data under a daily fine of R$ 10,000. In the Twitter Files, Twitter's legal team argued that the TSE's decision did not consider any specific content posted by the profile that could be considered illegal or irregular. They stated that the order was based solely on the profile's association with a third-party site and argued that they could remove specific illegal content without needing to suspend the entire profile. Therefore, they challenged the decision, claiming disproportionality and a lack of specificity in analyzing the actual content of the @BolsoflixReal profile.

Similar to the Bolsoflix case, the TSE ordered the shutdown of the site "," linked to Lula's campaign. The justification was that the site and the associated Twitter profile, @verdadenarede, misled the public by presenting themselves as an independent fact-checking agency, while in reality, they were part of the official electoral campaign.

According to an internal Twitter email sent by a lawyer member of the company's legal team (anonymized here because she is not senior), the platform challenged the TSE's decision. The legal team argued that no analysis of specific content posted that could be considered illegal or irregular had been conducted. They emphasized that while they could remove specific illegal content, the total suspension of the profile was disproportionate and based solely on the profile's association with a third-party site.

Both the Bolsoflix and Verdade na Rede profiles remain “withheld in Brazil in response to a legal demand.”[verdadenarede.com.br](http://verdadenarede.com.br/)

## Attorney General's Office requests data from old tweets of journalist

Another case involves Rede Globo’s TV host Felipe Andreoli (@andreolifelipe), who became a target of the Attorney General's Office. Andreoli led “cancel campaigns” against the volleyball player Maurício Souza (@VoleiSouza) accused of homophobic behavior. Now Souza is a federal deputy. Subsequently, Andreoli himself was canceled due to several prejudiced tweets he posted in 2010.

Although Andreoli has apologized and stated that he is now a "better person," the Federal Public Ministry sent a request to Twitter for the preservation of IPs related to these tweets. Twitter refused to comply with the request as it had not received the specific URLs, only screenshots. Moreover, the requirements of the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty in Criminal Matters (MLAT) were not followed.

## A Call for Change

These cases show that, although the right has been persecuted more intensely in recent years, the left can also be affected by censorship or improper data requests.

In 2014, Brazil approved the “Marco Civil da Internet”, a law that ensures rights and establishes duties in the use of the internet in the country. Implemented after extensive discussion with society, this is a robust law that guarantees the protection of privacy and personal data of users, stipulating that any collection, use, or disclosure of personal information must be done with transparency, specific purpose, and user consent. The law also protects freedom of speech on the internet, ensuring that access and use of the network are free and that there is no prior censorship.

In addition to the “Marco Civil da Internet”, Brazil has a specific law to protect the privacy and data of citizens on the internet, the General Data Protection Law (LGPD), approved in 2018.

Instead of respecting the Marco Civil da Internet and the LGPD, the Brazilian government has been trying to pass bills that put freedom of expression at risk. One of these bills is PL2630, also known as the Fake News Bill. NGOs funded by billionaires, such as George Soros, left-wing activists, and supporters of President Lula have been defending such proposals, taking advantage of a current judicial trend in their favor. But to whom will they appeal when the judges decide to switch sides (once again)?__
