We subpoenaed Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Rumble, TikTok and X. Why? Foreign governments are trying to silence American speech—in the United States. We have a problem with that.

Last night, the Committee issued subpoenas to eight major tech companies. Foreign governments are putting pressure on them to censor American speech. Once we receive these documents, we’ll know which foreign officials are pressuring tech companies to censor Americans.

Knowing which foreign officials pressured Big Tech to silence Americans is important. Yesterday, the Committee passed the No Censors on Our Shores Act. It would allow the federal government to deport foreign censors or deny foreign censors from entering the U.S. [https://x.com/JudiciaryGOP/status/1894809625477972110…](https://x.com/JudiciaryGOP/status/1894809625477972110)

This is all crucial to stopping foreign censorship before it’s too late. The European Union, Brazil, and Australia have attempted to censor American citizens and companies.

We pressed [@Henna Virkkunen](https://x.com/HennaVirkkunen "Henna Virkkunen"), the European Commissioner responsible for enforcing the EU’s censorship law, last month.

But the foreign censors won’t stop. Brazil, Europe, Australia, and others still want to censor Americans—and they think they can.

We’re not having it. American citizens and American companies are directly impacted. Our subpoenas compel these tech companies to turn over foreign government demands to censor U.S. speech. And some companies have already begun to comply…

The Committee will continue to investigate how and to what extent foreign government officials have attempted to pressure companies to censor the American people. Stay tuned.
