In April 2022, Scott Hamilton, a former American diplomat, wrote an article for the newspaper O Globo. Printed edition newspaper of Grupo Globo de Comunica√ß√£o.

The theme of this article: ‚ÄúDefending Democracy‚Äù

Follow the thread and understand how this article is related to interference in the 2022 elections in Brazil. üß∂__

Brazil knows well, from the bitter experience with the military dictatorship, that when democracy dies, it is difficult to resurrect it. The global example of Brazilian democratic power and prestige has more value today as a counterpoint to the growing advance of autocracy around the world than at any time in the history of the country. But, amid credible threats to democratic institutions and values in Brazil, the United States remains passive before the public. It would be tragic if they compensated for their erroneous and openly comfortable previous identification with President Jair Bolsonaro now complacently hiding in the shadows.__

As consul general in Rio between 2018 and 2021, I witnessed the ways in which Bolsonaro and his supporters tried to sabotage the integrity of the Brazilian democratic process and its, in general, spectacular independent democratic institutions - press, NGOs, TSE, STF and the voting system itself. The intention is clear and dangerous: to undermine the faith of the public and prepare the stage for the effort to refuse to accept its result. Have no doubt, Bolsonaro sees himself as an envoy of God to save Brazil from ‚Äúcommunism‚Äù. It is a messianic view impervious to reason. The presence of Carlos Bolsonaro, his campaign leader on social networks, in the delegation that in March met Vladimir Putin, president of a country that is a sophisticated digital election manipulator, should leave us with the flea behind our ear.__

The Brazilian electronic voting system is first-rate ‚Äî fast and reliable, with an unrechocable history and no loophole for politically motivated authorities to delay the count while votes for a losing candidate are mysteriously ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù. That‚Äôs why, of course, Bolsonaro repudiates him. It is because he fought for the paper vote, easier to challenge as a party count, as we have seen to our unhappiness in the United States. It is because it disputes the integrity of the TSE, in order to offer another way to discredit the legitimacy of the results. It is because it paints the press as partial, in order to minimize all the reports it can make about its efforts to steal the election. It is because he disdains NGOs as if they were at the service of the left or international interests, to be able to suggest that they are not reliable. It is because it fights the Supreme Court, since ministers may decide on their refusal to leave the Presidency. And it is because it cultivates the Military Police so much, because it needs to be ready to send it to the streets against pro-democracy demonstrations, even against the desire of the chain of command linked to the state governors.__

First of all, the United States should make it crystal clear to President Bolsonaro that an attempt to interfere in the integrity of the Brazilian electoral process will be the object of absolute repudiation and punitive sanctions to all involved, imposed simultaneously by a large group of countries. Second, the Biden administration should be more aggressive in supporting the independent democratic institutions of Brazil. Finally, for now, the related diplomatic community should adopt similar public activities that make clear its own commitment to democratic institutions and values.__

Based on this blog written by Scott Hamilton, the intervention movement in Brazil emerged through digital platforms, such as Meta applications, Google, TikTok, Kwai and Twitter.

The way of intervention of the digital media was due to the overthrow of the engagement of people with ideological bias opposite to the political spectrum facing the left.

And not only that, the meetings of Brazilian authorities in mid-2021 met with the director of the CIA (USA) who sent a message at Biden‚Äôs request to Bolsonaro to avoid criticizing the Brazilian democratic process and not questioning the elections in Brazil.__

CIA (US Intelligence Agency) director William Burns told high-ranking members of the Brazilian government that President Jair Bolsonaro (PL) should stop casting doubt on Brazilian electronic voting. The information was published this Thursday (5) by the international news agency Reuters , which claims to have heard sources with knowledge of the matter who asked not to have their names published.

According to Reuters, Burns' warning occurred in a closed-door meeting with members of the Bolsonaro government held in July 2021, at Pal√°cio do Planalto, in Bras√≠lia. Officially, they discussed issues relating to "the promotion of democracy, security and stability" in South America, according to a letter sent to the Chamber of Deputies by the Minister of the Institutional Security Office (GSI) of the Presidency of the Republic, Augusto Heleno, two months after the meeting, to which the newspaper O Globo had access.__

The CIA director is still one of the highest officials of the current American government to have met with representatives of the Brazilian government. Since Joe Biden took office, bilateral relations between Brazil and the USA have cooled (Bolsonaro openly defended Donald Trump's re-election). According to the sources heard by the report, it is unusual for CIA directors to send political messages to authorities in other countries. But this would have been a request from Biden himself.__

Bolsonaro often questions the security and reliability of the electronic voting machine. And, last year, he defended a proposed amendment to the Constitution (PEC) that reinstituted the printed vote in Brazil to audit elections. The PEC was overturned in a vote in the Chamber of Deputies.__

According to Reuters, when he was in Bras√≠lia, Burns met with Bolsonaro himself and General Augusto Heleno, from the GSI, as well as Alexandre Ramagem, at the time director of the Brazilian Intelligence Agency, Abin.

During the same visit to Bras√≠lia, Burns also had dinner with Heleno and General Luiz Eduardo Ramos, at the time minister of the Civil House and who is currently minister of the General Secretariat of the Presidency, at the US embassy in Bras√≠lia. Reuters reported that, at dinner, the two generals sought to downplay Bolsonaro's claims that Brazil's elections could be rigged.

The report also says that, in response, the director told Heleno and Ramos that the democratic process was "sacred" and that Bolsonaro should not be speaking that way. "Burns was making it clear that the elections were not something they should mess with," said one of the sources interviewed by the CIA.

According to Reuters, the warning for Bolsonaro to stop questioning the elections in Brazil was reinforced a month later to Brazilian authorities by the US National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan. He was also in Brazil and met with Bolsonaro. But, according to the report, Burns' message would have been "stronger" than Sullivan's.__

Reuters reached out to the CIA and the Brazilian government for comment. According to the report, the CIA declined to comment. The GSI said in a statement that Burns' meeting was publicly announced, but warned that "the matters discussed in the intelligence meetings are confidential." The office also highlighted that "the GSI does not receive messages from any country in the world, nor does it transmit them."__

At the end of the article by @gazetadopovo is the mention of Scott Hamilton, which I cited his text at the beginning of this thread and his influence on the subject of a previously punitive nature to Jair Bolsonaro on the criticism of the Brazilian electoral process.

Continuing on the subject of digital platforms, we have here a person from within the old Twitter who gave a strength to Minister Lu√≠s Roberto Barroso, who at the time in 2022 at the time was president of the TSE (Superior Electoral Court)

Daniele Kleiner, head of Public Policy at Twitter at the time in 2022, has already worked in the Dilma government

She was one of those responsible for the partnership in the fight against misinformation in the 2022 elections__

@gazetadopovo Daniele Kleiner has also worked on Facebook.

Interestingly, there are photos of the space she reformulated naming the rooms of important figures within the historical context in the left political axis

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKsaC-bX0AEYt8y.jpg)

Image

At the event, Daniele Kleiner, head of Public Policy at Twitter, said that ensuring that the platform continues to be a place for open and healthy conversations is undoubtedly a priority of the company. ‚ÄúAnd it is in this sense that Twitter reinforces its commitment to protect civic integrity and freedom of expression for this year‚Äôs elections,‚Äù added Daniele, praising the performance of the Electoral Justice and, in particular of the TSE, in the fight against misinformation in the context of the elections.

Manoela Alc√¢ntara, from Metr√≥poles, interviews Daniele Kleiner, Twitter‚Äôs leader of Public Policies in Brazil.

In the minute 21:20 Daniele explains about the ban and withdrawal of accounts that offered risk to Democracy

But it does not specifically say how these accounts will be banned and blocked

__

@gazetadopovo @TSEjusbr But in practice the withdrawal and banning of accounts were happening as follows:

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKsbiTEXkAA5nPa.jpg)

Image

@gazetadopovo @TSEjusbr That said, it marries exactly with TWITTER FILES BRAZIL.

There was no smoothness in the democratic debate, because not even one account of the left suffered retention.

Only CIVIL people and right-wing politicians were censored and persecuted and had their rights violated.__

On March 7, 2024, @elonmusk brought up important information about how this account suspension occurred in Brazil.

‚ÄúElon Musk explains that Alexandre de Moraes instructed X to suspend accounts, including those of journalists and politicians in office, and not even inform them that this was by court order.

Platform X was instructed to lie to them and tell users that this (account retention/ban) violated the site‚Äôs terms of service.‚Äù__

Alexandre de Moraes continued the Machiavellian plan of control and prior censorship initiated by Lu√≠s Roberto Barroso, who left the presidency of the TSE on June 15, 2022.

Luis Roberto Barroso has strong relations with the Open Society Foudation, In the video in question he is with CLAIRE:[![](https://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1777547349209886720/img/gV7W7LKAxejar9UI.jpg)](https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1777547349209886720/pl/nB8fnJe4R12Uzx5-.m3u8?tag=14\&container=cmaf)__

Several spheres of Brazil‚Äôs powers are involved with American entities, NGOs or authorities of which they have weakened the pro-right political scenario in the country.

And relations between them increased after the inauguration of President Lula.

The CIA Director has already been in Brazil on two occasions from 2023 to now.

He was even here last month, on March 19th.__

The Minister, substitute, of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Maria Laura da Rocha, received the Director of @CIA, William Joseph Burns. They talked about the traditional #cooperation between üáßüá∑ and üá∫üá∏, in particular in the fight against misinformation and the strengthening of democratic institutions.__

We had the leak of the images of the Hungarian Embassy where they denounced the presence of former President Jair Messias Bolsonaro.

Claiming that he was seeking asylum in Hungary.

The leak was given to the NYT, through journalist Jack Nicas

Interestingly, Jack Nicas received in September 2023 in New York, the Minister of Culture, Margareth Menezes.

In other words, he also has government sources to help him manipulate the situation of Brazilian democracy on the international scene.

Satellite images were released from the embassy site. This is a crisis of sovereignty that Brazil is experiencing.

Here everything can be used to attack opponents.

We have spies infiltrated in our country.__

@CIA On March 25, I brought the memory of the Minister‚Äôs visit to New York:

We have other people from the Brazilian government who have relations with American foreigners.

The secretariat of digital rights of the office of the Brazilian Ministry of Justice is in favor of the regulation of platforms and very close to internal figures of the workers‚Äô party, which is President Lula‚Äôs.__

In an article released on March 7 by BBC News Brazil:

'Musk's action is an attack by foreign forces on democratic institutions in Brazil,' says former Secretary of Digital Rights

![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKsks1YW8AArblT.jpg)

Image

Former Secretary of Digital Rights of the Ministry of Justice, lawyer Estela Aranha sees the recent actions of billionaire Elon Musk, owner of X (former Twitter), as ‚Äúan attack by foreign far-right political forces on democratic institutions in Brazil‚Äù.

Over the weekend, the businessman made strong criticism of the Brazilian Judiciary, especially Minister Alexandre de Moraes, of the Federal Supreme Court (STF), and threatened to reactivate profiles deleted by court decision.

Musk said that Moraes ‚Äúshould resign or be impeached‚Äù. The billionaire also said that the minister ‚Äúshamlessly and repeatedly betrayed the constitution and the people of Brazil‚Äù.

Aranha, who until last month led the Secretariat of Digital Rights of the Ministry of Justice, states that the episode with the billionaire shows that Brazil urgently needs adequate regulation for social networks, in addition to establishing the responsibilities of these platforms.

But who is Estela Aranha?

Let‚Äôs get to know her better?

Estela Aranha, former direct secretary of Fl√°vio Dino as Minister of Justice.

However, it is still allocated to the folder in the function of secretary, but not of Digital Rights.

Felipe Neto‚Äôs great friend, the digital influencer project of censorship in Brazil, through his Vero Institute.

Interesting, isn‚Äôt it?

Felipe Neto is a great democratic censor project, also sponsored by the Open Society Foundation, via its VERO Institute.

Felipe throughout the weekend in the demonstrations of Elon Musk denouncing the censorship in Brazil, Elon strongly criticized by the young Brazilian who has great influence in working groups of PL2630, a law that will process the regulation of digital platforms in Brazil.

Look how cool, Estela Aranha is also super close to Data Privacy, another agency affiliated with the Open Society Foudantion and that is helping in the censorship of Brazil.

In the text of the publication below, I emphasize the following excerpt:

‚ÄúI talked about the prospects for 2023: the rising theme will be regulation of platforms, especially as a reaction to the massive rapid growth of the radicalization of the extreme right, which are also related to the architecture of social networks. If on the one hand action in this direction is urgent and necessary, some privacy preservation technologies, such as cryptography, are at risk.‚Äù

It transits even with the base of the creators and founders of the PT who are part of the theology of the liberation of the Catholic Church here in South America

Here we have Estela Aranha to the right of the photo, next to the first lady, Janja Lula.

Here Estela Aranha embraced Flavio Dino, in his possession as Minister of the Federal Supreme Court, appointed by Lula, without the due appreciation of the Brazilian population. Dino is the newest minister of the Brazilian supreme court, side pair of Alexandre de Moraes and Lu√≠s Roberto Barroso.

In Estela‚Äôs Instagram post, she mentions Dino‚Äôs reference to a hero:

‚ÄúNot all heroes wear capes, but there is one that uses‚Äù

And to close this thread, I conclude that we had more interference in the elections. Not the fraud at the polls, but the fraud in the lack of smoothness of our right to participate in the democratic debate. Our networks have dropped reach, that‚Äôs when the accounts were not dropped without even understanding the reason.

As mentioned earlier, it was governmental and non-governmental entities that contributed to getting where we are today in Brazil.

From federal agents to journalists and government officials.

That wasn‚Äôt right. We had no right of reply while we were called extreme right, extremists, fascists and anti-democratics. We were silent and had our reputation murdered. Just like the traditional press and who receive Funds from the Brazilian federal government, are doing with the reputation of Elon Musk on the national scene.

Thank you for reading if you‚Äôve come this far.__

In correction time, the correct date in this thread sequence is April 7, 2024.

I add here a compilation of my friend and follower, @\_Spartan228

He compiled information at the time about the relationship of Burns and Biden, in the interference in the Brazilian electoral process of 2022.

To complete and close with a golden key, in this podcast released today by the Globo de Comunica√ß√£o group, Estela Aranha criminalizes without evidence and evidence, the speech of opponents about the Lulista regime and as well as accuses Elon Musk of not complying with Brazilian legislation.__
